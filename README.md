#### PyFUND [Work-in-Progress]

This project is an attempt to port the [FUND](https://www.github.com/fund-model/fund) to Python, so that data can be more readily computed on non-Microsoft platforms.

This project is being worked on at the University of Chicago's [Computation Institute](https://ci.uchicago.edu).
